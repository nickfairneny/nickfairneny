    <h1>The Best Title Ever</h1>
    <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some <strong>advice</strong> that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever
since.</p>
<p><a name = "top"></a>“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just
remember that all the people in this world <strong>haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</strong></p>
<p>He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. <strong>In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not
a few veteran bores.</strong> The abnormal mind is quick to detect and
attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person,
and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of
wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought —
frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate
revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I
am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as
my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a
sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally
at birth.
